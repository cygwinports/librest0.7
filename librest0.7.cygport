SUMMARY="RESTful web services API library"
DESCRIPTION="This library was designed to make it easier to access web
services that claim to be RESTful. It should be noted that the majority of
services don't actually adhere to the strict definition of RESTful. Instead,
their RESTful end point usually has an API that is just simpler to use
compared to other types of APIs they may support (XML-RPC, for instance).
It is this kind of API that this library is attempting to support."
